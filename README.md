# Fractal-Trees-with-Turtle-Matplotlib-generate-random-fractals-with-different-colors.
Below are two ready-to-run implementations :  Matplotlib version — fast, produces a high-quality PNG, uses color maps so branches/leaves vary by depth.  Turtle version — live drawing (nice for videos/screens-records), with randomness and color variations; includes how to save the turtle canvas as an image.
